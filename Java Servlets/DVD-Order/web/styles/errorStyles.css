/*This styling rule applies to any element with the class attribute
equal to "pageText".
The font-family indicates that courier, helvetica, or verdana will be chosen
depending on browser support, and if no browser supports these fonts, then
a simple sans-serif font will be used.
The font-size is medium and the font-weight is bold so it stands out.
The color specifies the text color, which is the same as all of the
text on the page and other pages.*/
