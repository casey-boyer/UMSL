Use OpenCV to create an 8-bit single-channel image of size 640x480 pixels.  
In this image, at random locations, place a square of size 100x100 pixels, a rectangle of size 200x160 pixels, and a circle of diameter 70 pixels.  
Your background should be black.  For each object, the center pixel of the object will be black.  
Other pixels will be given a grayscale value as d where d is the distance of the pixel from the object center (maximized at 255).  
Make sure that you crop the objects at the borders.  If two objects overlap, the object being drawn late takes precedence.  
Call your executable objects.  Make sure you display the image on screen.

Handin a copy of the source and Makefile on hoare.  Create your program in a directory called username.1 where username is your login name on hoare.  
Once you are done with everything, remove the executables and object files, and issue the following commands:

cd

chmod 755 ~

~sanjiv/bin/handin cs5420 1

chmod 700 ~
