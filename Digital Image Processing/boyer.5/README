Assignment #5, Due 11/28/2018

Getting executable:
	-You make invoke 'make' or 'make ass5' to get the exectuable.

Invocation:
	-'./ass5' will remove the periodic noise from the noisy_backyard.jpg
	  image in this directory.

NOTES:
 	-The functions used are defined in utilities.cpp, and prototyped
	 in utilities.h.

	-I attempted to remove the periodic noise in the frequency domain
	 by finding the regions in the spectrum with abrupt changes. This
	 was done using the setMouseCallback() function provided by
	 openCv, and selecting these areas as rectangles.

	-After obtaining these areas to remove the frequency, I assigned
	 the value 0 to both the real and imaginary parts of the
	 fourier transformed image in these areas. The program will
	 display the spectrum after noise removal, and this will show
	 where I removed the frequency.

	-The output image, that is, the fourier transformed image with
	 periodic noise removed and then transformed back into spatial domain,
	 appears to be incorrect. It is visibly brighter, and I am not
	 sure that I performed noise removal correctly, as the horizontal
	 and vertical lines are still present across the image.
	 This may have to do with how I transformed the image back
	 into spatial domain; after modifying the real and imaginary
	 parts of the image to remove noise, I merged these images
	 back into the fourier transformed image, and then calculated
	 the inverse DFT to obtain the real part of the image in
	 spatial domain. I think I may be missing a step here. 
	 However, I did test to make sure that I could transform
	 the noisy_backyard image to frequency domain and back to spatial
	 domain, and I was able to do so without any problems.
